# ScrapeUSGasPrices


The motivation behind this project is my inability to find daily gas prices by city in the USA. So, I wrote this crawler which scrapes gas price data daily from the [AAA Gas Prices](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) website. The website provides data on average gas prices in 457 cities in the USA. 

Notes:

- The data could not be scraped for a week. I was away on a trip to Washington DC and was unable to fix it when I got the notification.

March 19-24, 2022

The missing data can be imputed using any technique. Code coming soon...
